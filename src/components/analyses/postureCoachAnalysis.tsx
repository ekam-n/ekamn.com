              Posture Coach is a lightweight computer-vision project that fine-tunes a
              small YOLO classifier to recognize three webcam posture states—
              “looks good,” “sit up straight,” and “straighten head”—and provide
              fast, practical feedback for students and desk workers using typical
              laptop setups.

          <p>
            To achieve this, we built a computer vision pipeline in Python using a YOLO-based classifier in a supervised learning setup, fine-tuning it on three labeled posture classes. We curated and split our dataset into train/validation/test sets, tracked experiments and checkpoints, and iterated on hyperparameters to improve accuracy, precision/recall, and F1. Finally, we validated the model on a held-out test set in different environments, using Git to coordinate development.
